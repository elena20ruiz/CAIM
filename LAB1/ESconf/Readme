ElasticSearch Configuration
===========================

Copy elasticsearch.yaml and log4j2.properties to a directory (for example /tmp/ESconf)

Create directories for the data and the logs (for example /tmp/data and /tmp/logs)

Edit elasticsearch.yaml to point to the paths of the data and the logfiles directories

Start elastic search with:

$ /path/to/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch -Epath.conf=/path/to/configuration/files

-----------

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
====================

In some installs of ElasticSearch an error appears running the service complaining about writing to a configuration
file regarding JAVA security, some times it continues without problem, sometimes the service does not start.

The solution is to defile the variable ES_JAVA_OPTS so this check is disregarded. Defining this variable depends on the
unix shell that you are using, if tou are using bash you have to type the following in a terminal:

$ export ES_JAVA_OPTS='-Dlog4j2.disable.jmx=true'
